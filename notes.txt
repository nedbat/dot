- done: never delete well-known files: move them aside instead
- todo: better doc for the post-install steps needed
- todo: new dirs in ~/.config don't get copied to ~/dot/.config
- files are in .config/nedbat/.[a-z], they need to be sourced from their home equivalents
    for f in ~/.config/nedbat/.[a-z]*; do
        echo $f is $(basename $f)
        echo "source $f" >> ~/$(basename $f)
    done
- minimal brew list:
    git
    starship
    macvim
    hammerspoon
    rg
    eza
- done: notes.md shouldn't end up in the tarball
- hammerspoon needs to enable accessibility through its ui
    - and enable location services.
        - in the hammerspoon console, run this lua: print(hs.location.get())
        - then in system settings - privacy - location services, enable hammerspoon
- textual:
    - re-connect the custom style
    - choose franklin gothic book 18pt
    - style - developers - modify custom stylesheet rules
        - * {line-height: 1.25}

- todo: no need to link to .config from .gitconfig.personal
- todo: forking commands to add a remote

# From $JOB-1:
- We don't assume we own ~/.zshrc: we add one line to it
- We don't assume ~/.zshenv, ~/.zlogin, etc, exist
- We can move .config somewhere else by creating a symlink at ~/dotroot that points to a directory with .config in it
- XDG_CONFIG_HOME should always be set and used to find .config/
- A .gitconfig.ned file might exist and should be the global config if it does. It can [include] the common configs.
